A simple room reservation system for RPI

# Install

Python and Node are required for the install script to run properly.

To install, run the install script in the scripts directory:
```
./scripts/intsall.sh
```

Given that there are no issues, you can run the server on your local machine with:
```
./scripts/run.sh
```

Done :)
